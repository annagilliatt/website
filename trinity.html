Trinity's beautiful campus overlooks the city of San Antonio, and its close proximity to downtown provides its 
students with a large variety of activities. The school is recognized in the U.S. 
as the no. 1 school in the west for 25 years, according to U.S. News & World Report's "America's Best Colleges".
With rigorous academics, tenured professors and NCAA division three sports, Trinity holds a high reputation nationally.
the outstanding student-teacher ratio of 9:1 allows students easy access to help from professors, and the small size
of classes ensures that professors will know your name, which is hard to come by at larger schools. Trinity is known for its diverse students as it accepts
many international students.
